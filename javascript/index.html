<P class="a">Enzo Anselmo Giuseppe Maria Ferrari, founder of <br> Ferrari company had a vision. Starting out as <br> an italian motor racing driver, he started and developed
  <br>the
  Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team. <br> In his later years he went on to branch the company out  into the luxerous automobile it is today.</P>
  <p class="b"> Enzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with headquarters in Modena.
    Scuderia Ferrari literally means "Ferrari Stable" and is usually used to mean "Team Ferrari."
    Ferrari bought, prepared, and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars for gentleman drivers, functioning as the racing
    division of Alfa Romeo. In 1933, Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and Scuderia Ferrari took over as
    its works team the Scuderia received Alfa's Grand Prix cars of the latest specifications and fielded many
    famous drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi. In 1938, Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again
    in-house, forming Alfa Corse in Milan and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department; therefore
    the Scuderia Ferrari was disbanded. In September 1939, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the provision he would not
    use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years. A few days later he founded
     Auto Avio Costruzioni, headquartered in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari. The new company ostensibly
      produced machine tools and aircraft accessories. In 1940, Ferrari produced a race car the Tipo 815, based on
      a Fiat platform. It was the first Ferrari car and debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia, but due to World War II it
      saw little competition. In 1943, the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since.
      The factory was bombed by the Allies and subsequently rebuilt including works for road car production.
