      Lithe and voluptuous, the 2020 Ferrari F8 Tributo is the supercar to choose if you like your automotive
      performance packaged in an undeniably glamorous wrapperâ€”and who doesn't? With its chiseled panels and windblown
      profile, the F8 Tributo looks more beautiful than brash, which sets it apart from other cars in Ferrari's stable.
       This coupe is new to the Ferrari lineup for the 2020 model year, stepping in to replace the outgoing 488GTB.
        Memorably quick off the line, the F8 Tributo is motivated by the same burly 710-hp V-8 that lives under the
        hood of the 488 Pista. This alluring coupe costs more than an Ivy League education, but its price is justified
        by its winning style and breathtaking performance.
