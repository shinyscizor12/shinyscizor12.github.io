        Over the years Ferrari has introduced a series of supercars which have represented the
        very pinnacle of the companyâ€™s technological achievements transferred to its road cars.
        These include the GTO, F40 and F50. This family of extreme performance cars was joined in
        2002 by the Enzo Ferrari, which was the expression of the latest Formula 1 technology and know-how.
        One of just 399 Enzos originally produced by Ferrari, and the number of the cars left in a happy state
        has dwindled over the years. This particular Enzo isn't for sale.
