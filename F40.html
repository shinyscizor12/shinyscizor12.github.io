        The Ferrari F40 (Type F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car engineered by Nicola Materazzi
        with styling by Pininfarina. It was built from 1987 to 1992, with the LM and GTE race car versions continuing
        production until 1994 and 1996 respectively. While debuting in 1987 with a suggested retail price of $400,000,
        some of the Ferrari car listings sold for an estimated $1.6 million up until the 1992 cut-off of model production.
        A mid-engine model, the Ferrari F40 specs a 2.9-liter twin-turbo, rear mid-longitudinal V8 engine. With a horsepower
        production of 163 hp/liter and a maximum torque of 425 lb-ft at 4,000 rpm, it comes as no surprise that the F40 found its
        place in the field of competitive racing.
