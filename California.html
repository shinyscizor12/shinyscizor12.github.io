        Some of the most valuable classic cars in the world are Ferraris and another one just sold
        at auction for a staggering price, and it isn’t even red. A 1959 Ferrari 250 GT LWB California
        Spider just sold at RM Sotheby’s auction in New York for $17.99 billion. The hammer price was
        expected to be between $14 and $17 million. This car has a few things going for it that makes it
        extremely valuable. For starters, it’s one of only eight built with an aluminum body. It also
        finished third place in its class and fifth place overall at Le Mans in 1959 which was won by
        Carroll Shelby. Its rarity combined with its pristine condition and racing heritage was a formula
        for big bucks on the auction block.
